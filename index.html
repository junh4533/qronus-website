                                    joined Ascend 2 years ago and it was the best decision I ever made in college. To be
                                    involved in a diverse community of aspiring business leaders opened new doors and
                                    paths for me, both professionally and socially. Along the way, I have met some
                                    extraordinary people and gained new friends. Some of my favorite things to do
                                    outside the classroom and work environment would be going to basketball games and
                                    just venturing around new places and discovering new ears, I love to travel as well.
                                    I am excited to be serving the Baruch community as Vice President of Marketing and I
